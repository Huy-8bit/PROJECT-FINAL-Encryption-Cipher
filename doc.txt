AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that was designed to be efficient and secure. It was adopted as a standard by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide.
AES uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It is a block cipher, which means that it encrypts data in fixed-size blocks. The algorithm works by taking a block of plaintext as input, and producing a block of ciphertext as output. It uses a secret key to encrypt the plaintext, and the same key (or a related key) is used to decrypt the ciphertext.
AES is a strong and secure encryption algorithm, and it is widely used for data encryption, particularly in applications where security is critical, such as in financial transactions, online communication, and storage of sensitive data. It is also used in various software applications, including web browsers, email clients, and file encryption tools.
